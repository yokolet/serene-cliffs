Item Catalog Porject
====================

This is a repository for the Item Catalog Project.
Since the app will run on Vagrant virtual machine,
the app needs VirtualBox and Vagrant installed.

- VirtualBox: <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox>
- Vagrant: <https://www.vagrantup.com/>


If VirtualBox and Vagrant have been installed successfully:

1. go to `vagrant` directory
2. start vagrant by `vagrant up`
3. login to virtual machine by `vagrant ssh`

The Item Catalog code is in `/vagrant/catalog` directory.


For further information about the app,
see [README in catalog](catalog/README.md).
